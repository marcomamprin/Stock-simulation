Stock Price Simulation 📈

This project simulates stock price movements using a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model. The simulation runs entirely in the web browser and allows users to tweak parameters like expected return, volatility, and risk-free rate.

Features

✅ Real-time stock price simulations
✅ Adjustable parameters (return, volatility, risk, etc.)
✅ Interactive Plotly charts
✅ Dark mode support 🌙
✅ Works on GitHub Pages (no server needed!)
